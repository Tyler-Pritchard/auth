This application will grant authorization to a user by using Google's Firebase authorization app.
Firebase Auth is a service that can authenticate users using only client-side code. It supports social login providers Facebook, GitHub, Twitter and Google (and Google Play Games). Additionally, it includes a user management system whereby developers can enable user authentication with email and password login stored with Firebase.
